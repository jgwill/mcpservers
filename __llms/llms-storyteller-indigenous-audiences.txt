# Shawn Wilson's Lecture Notes 251022

## Researcher Background - Introducing the Storyteller

The use of an Indigenous research paradigm when studying Indigenous peoples requires the holistic use and transmission of information. Consequently, I present the information in this study in a way that is more culturally appropriate for Indigenous people by taking the role of storyteller rather than researcher/author. Indigenous people in Canada recognize that it is important for storytellers to impart their own life and experience into the telling. They also recognize that listeners will filter the story being told through their own experience and thus adapt the information to make it relevant and specific to their life. When listeners know where the storyteller is coming from and how the story fits into the storyteller's life, it makes the absorption of the knowledge that much easier. This is also the premise of Indigenous Australian oral traditions. This text is written in the first and second person, as a reflection of this tradition.

It is necessary for me to provide you with my background details and to explain how my role as storyteller has been enhanced by my interest in an Indigenous research paradigm. Travelling and meeting people from different cultures has always held a fascination for me. My upbringing taught me to treasure differences between cultures, though in meeting Indigenous people in Canada, United States, South-east Asia, Norway, New Zealand and Australia, I have noticed that we share similar beliefs and a common spirituality. I have often wondered how Indigenous peoples from opposite sides of the earth could have values that are so alike. Consequently, my interest in this study has grown because of my belief that Indigenous people share a unique way of thinking because of the prevalence of a common Indigenous epistemology.

My observations have led me to develop the topic of an Indigenous research paradigm. In addition to knowing my motivations as a researcher, you should also be familiar with the terms that I use and before going any further, I will clarify these.

<output>When working with storytellers, particularly within Indigenous contexts, it is essential to recognize that knowledge transmission is a holistic and relational process. The storyteller's personal experience and background are not separate from the narrative but are integral to its meaning and absorption by the listener. This approach acknowledges that listeners will interpret and adapt the information based on their own lived experiences, making the storyteller's context crucial for relevance. The aim is to foster a deep understanding by creating a bridge between the storyteller's perspective and the listener's world, facilitating a more profound connection with the wisdom being shared.

<input>
Extract 5 questions for developping the framework in various potential areas of the core features it needs if we want it to be agnostic narrative context protocol (NCP) but extended to be hollistically oriented (which is probably based on a concentric circular enhanced visualization) 
</input>
<output>


How can the framework's core principles be articulated to transcend specific narrative genres or cultural origins, allowing for universal application? This question probes the adaptability of the framework's foundational elements to diverse storytelling traditions and forms.
What mechanisms can be embedded to ensure the preservation of emotional architecture and structural integrity when transforming narratives across vastly different contexts? This focuses on the core challenge of maintaining the essence of a story while adapting its surface elements.
How can the framework facilitate the identification and integration of universal themes and core messages that resonate across human experiences, regardless of domain? This addresses the need to extract and re-apply the enduring wisdom within narratives.
In what ways can the framework support a concentric, circular visualization of knowledge, allowing for a holistic understanding that expands outward from core principles? This explores the structural and visual representation of the knowledge base, emphasizing interconnectedness.
What processes can be designed to enable the framework to dynamically adapt and learn from new narrative forms and contextual transformations, fostering continuous evolution? This question addresses the framework's capacity for growth and its ability to remain relevant in an ever-changing landscape of storytelling.
